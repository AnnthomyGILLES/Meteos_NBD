# Weather Data Aggregation and Real-time Processing

This project aims to aggregate weather data, store it and process it in real-time. The project is developed during my spare time. The objective is to show step by step how to develop such an application while being open to suggestions from the community. I might voluntarily use bad ( or at least not the best) practices for some steps, then show how I improve them step by step.

## Project Scope

The project will focus on aggregating weather data from various sources, storing it in a database and processing it in real-time. The application will have a user interface that displays current weather conditions and alerts users of any weather events that may occur. The project may evolve as [Your Name] gains more experience with the technology and receives feedback from the community.

## Technology Stack

The technology stack for this project is subject to change based on my analysis, experience, and desire to learn. However, the current plan includes the following:

- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL (+) or MongoDB (+++)
- Real-time Processing: Kafka
- Cloud Service: AWS (mayube) or my personal server

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.
